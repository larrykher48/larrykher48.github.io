    <p>I'm Larry Hernandez I am 16 years old<br>
This webpage was coded by me and I am still learning how to <br>
    get more comfortable with building websites and This website is <br>
        for my AP computer science class.
</p>
    <p> I've been playing soccer since i was just 7 years old and it has been a huge apart of my life as an athlete,<br>
        I also play for my high school team and my club team on the weekends and during school season. <br>
        In my free time I enjoy surfing all over the south and west facing shores, my favorite breaks include<br>
        Yokes, makaha, tracks, pokai bay, hau bush, shark country, and plenty of other breaks in town. </p>
